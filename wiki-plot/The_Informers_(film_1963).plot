<p>The story concerns the uneasy relationship between a Scotland Yard Detective, Johnnoe (Patrick), and the Squad Chief, Bestwick (Andrews), over the formerly traditional use of "<a href="/wiki/Informant" title="Informant">snouts</a>" (paid informants). Despite being told that these should no longer be used and to adopt more scientific principles of detection, Johnnoe continues to do so until one of his informants is murdered. He again disobeys orders and pursues his own lines of inquiry but as he closes in on the villains, they frame him for corruption and he is arrested and held in prison. With few friends left on his side of the law, his wife (Woodville) enlists the help of the murdered man's brother (Blakely).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
