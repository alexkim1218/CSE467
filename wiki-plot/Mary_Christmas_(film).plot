<p>Joel Wallace (Schneider), is a widower raising a daughter, Felice (<a href="/wiki/Jenna_Boyd" title="Jenna Boyd">Jenna Boyd</a>). In her Christmas letter to <a href="/wiki/Santa_Claus" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>, Felice wishes for a new mother for Christmas. The letter is intercepted by a local news producer who cancels reporter Mary Maloney's vacation and sends her to investigate the Wallace family as a human interest story. Most of the movie deals with Joel's searching for a new wife that will be Felice's mother.
</p><p>The ending takes a bit of a twist, though, when it turns out that Mary is Felice's birth mother, who had given her up for adoption. The movie incorporates a little extra magic with "governor" Les Turner whom Felice thinks is Santa Claus.
