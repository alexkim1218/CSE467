<p>As described in a <a href="/wiki/Film_magazine" class="mw-redirect" title="Film magazine">film magazine</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Rachel Hayne (Ayres), whose husband, a Southern soldier, is believed to have died in battle, renews a former love affair with Union fighter Colonel Charles Prescott (Holt). She also cultivates the friendship of another Northerner, Brigade Surgeon Fielding (Cain), for the purpose of obtaining <a href="/wiki/Quinine" title="Quinine">quinine</a> from him to pass on to Southern soldiers. Prescott is about to avow his love when the husband Captain Gordon Haine (Stone) returns. When Hayne is recaptured as a spy, Fielding accuses Prescott of trumping up the charge to dispose of the husband. Hayne escapes from his imprisonment, but is then recaptured, and after several incidents commits suicide. This leaves the love road free for his former wife, who never loved him, and the man to whom she has given her heart.
