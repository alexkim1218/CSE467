<p>In September 1939, <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Szpilman" title="Władysław Szpilman">Władysław Szpilman</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Polish-Jewish" class="mw-redirect" title="Polish-Jewish">Polish-Jewish</a> pianist, is playing live on the radio in <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> when the station is bombed during <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland" title="Invasion of Poland">invasion of Poland</a>. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when learning that <a href="/wiki/Phoney_War" title="Phoney War">Britain and France have declared war</a> on Germany. But the promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Soviet armies</a> invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled <a href="/wiki/General_Government" title="General Government">General Government</a>. Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses, and are also made to wear blue <a href="/wiki/Star_of_David" title="Star of David">Star of David</a> armbands.
</p><p>By November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced from their home into the overcrowded <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto" title="Warsaw Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a>, where conditions only get worse. People starve, the guards are brutal, and starving children are abandoned in the streets. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a round-up.
</p><p>On 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are transported to <a href="/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp" title="Treblinka extermination camp">Treblinka extermination camp</a> as part of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Reinhard" title="Operation Reinhard">Operation Reinhard</a>. But a friend in the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Ghetto_Police" title="Jewish Ghetto Police">Jewish Ghetto Police</a> recognizes Władysław at the <i><a href="/wiki/Umschlagplatz" title="Umschlagplatz">Umschlagplatz</a></i>, and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer, and learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages to escape, and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_Bogucki" title="Andrzej Bogucki">Andrzej Bogucki</a>, and his wife, <a href="/wiki/Andrzej_Bogucki" title="Andrzej Bogucki">Janina</a>.
</p><p>In April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">Warsaw Ghetto Uprising</a>, which he aided, unfolds, and then ultimately fails. After a neighbor discovers Szpilman in the flat, he is forced to flee to a second hiding place. The new room has a piano in it, but he is compelled to keep quiet, while beginning to suffer from jaundice.
</p><p>In August 1944, during the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" title="Warsaw Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" class="mw-redirect" title="Armia Krajowa">Armia Krajowa</a> attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. While trying to open it, he is discovered by <i><a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a></i> officer <a href="/wiki/Wilm_Hosenfeld" title="Wilm Hosenfeld">Wilm Hosenfeld</a> who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman manages to play Chopin's "<a href="/wiki/Ballades_(Chopin)#Ballade_No._1" title="Ballades (Chopin)">Ballade in G minor</a>". Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of the empty house. From here, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer.
</p><p>In January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the final time, promising he will listen to him on <a href="/wiki/Polskie_Radio" title="Polskie Radio">Polish Radio</a> after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm, and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp" class="mw-redirect" title="Nazi concentration camp">Nazi concentration camp</a> pass a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, who is among those captured, overhears an inmate lament over his former career as a violinist. He asks the violinist if he knows Szpilman, which he confirms. Hosenfeld wishes for Szpilman to return the favor and help release him. Sometime later, the violinist is able to bring Szpilman back to the site, but they find it abandoned.
</p><p>Later, Szpilman works for Polish Radio, and performs Chopin's "<a href="/wiki/Andante_spianato_et_grande_polonaise_brillante" title="Andante spianato et grande polonaise brillante">Grand Polonaise brillante</a>" to a large and prestigious audience. An epilogue states that Szpilman died at the age of 88 in the year 2000, while Hosenfeld died in Soviet captivity in 1952.
