<p>After his <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> trading ship <i><a href="/wiki/Erasmus" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a></i> and its surviving crew is blown ashore by a violent storm at Anjiro on the east coast of Japan, Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, the ship's English navigator, is taken prisoner by <a href="/wiki/Samurai" title="Samurai">samurai</a> warriors. When he is later temporarily released, he must juggle his self-identity as an Englishman associated with other Europeans in Japan, namely Portuguese traders and Jesuit priests, with the alien Japanese culture into which he has been thrust and now must adapt to in order to survive. Being an Englishman, Blackthorne is at both religious and political odds with his enemy, the Portuguese, and the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Jesuit" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> order. The Catholic foothold in Japan puts Blackthorne, a <a href="/wiki/Protestant" class="mw-redirect" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> and therefore a <a href="/wiki/Heretic" class="mw-redirect" title="Heretic">heretic</a>, at a political disadvantage. But this same situation also brings him to the attention of the influential Lord Toranaga, who mistrusts this foreign religion now spreading in Japan. He is competing with other samurai warlords of similar high-born rank, among them Catholic converts, for the very powerful position of Shōgun, the military governor of Japan.
</p><p>Through an interpreter, Blackthorne later reveals certain surprising details about the Portuguese traders and their Jesuit overlords which forces Toranaga to trust him; they forge a tenuous alliance, much to the chagrin of the Jesuits. To help the Englishman learn their language and to assimilate to Japanese culture, Toranaga assigns a teacher and interpreter to him, the beautiful Lady Mariko, a Catholic convert, and one of Toranaga's most trusted retainers. Blackthorne soon becomes infatuated with her, but Mariko is already married, and their budding romance is ultimately doomed by future circumstances.
</p><p>Blackthorne saves Toranaga's life by audaciously helping him escape from <a href="/wiki/Osaka_Castle" title="Osaka Castle">Osaka Castle</a> and the clutches of his longtime enemy, Lord Ishido. To reward the Englishman for saving his life, and to forever bind him to the warlord, Toranaga makes Blackthorne <i><a href="/wiki/Hatamoto" title="Hatamoto">hatamoto</a></i>, a personal retainer, and gifts him with a European <a href="/wiki/Flintlock" title="Flintlock">flintlock</a> pistol. Later, Blackthorne again saves Toranaga's life during an earthquake by pulling him from a fissure that opened and swallowed the warlord, nearly killing him. Having proved his worth and loyalty to the warlord, during a night ceremony held before a host of his assembled vassals and samurai, Lord Toranaga makes Blackthorne a samurai; he awards him the two swords, 20 <a href="/wiki/Kimonos" class="mw-redirect" title="Kimonos">kimonos</a>, 200 of his own samurai, and an income-producing <a href="/wiki/Fief" title="Fief">fief</a>, the fishing village Anjiro where Blackthorne was first blown ashore with his ship and crew. Blackthorne's repaired ship <i>Erasmus</i>, under guard by Toranaga's samurai and anchored near Kyoto, is lost to fire, which quickly spread when the ships' night lamps are knocked over by a storm <a href="/wiki/Tidal_surge" class="mw-redirect" title="Tidal surge">tidal surge</a>. During a later attack on Osaka Castle by the secretive Amida Tong (<a href="/wiki/Ninja" title="Ninja">Ninja</a> assassins), secretly paid for by Lord Ishido, Mariko is killed while saving Blackthorne's life, who is temporarily blinded by the <a href="/wiki/Black_powder" class="mw-redirect" title="Black powder">black powder</a> explosion that kills his lover. Lord Yabu is forced to commit seppuku for his involvement with the ninja attack and personally murdering Captain Yoshinaka. Right before he dies, Yabu gives Blackthorne his katana sword and Yabu's nephew, Omi, becomes the daimyo of Izu.
</p><p>Blackthorne supervises the construction of a new ship, <i>The Lady</i>, with funds Mariko left to him in her will for this very purpose. Blackthorne is observed at a distance by Lord Toranaga; a <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" title="Voice-over">voice-over</a> reveals the warlord's inner thoughts: It was he who ordered the <i>Erasmus</i> destroyed by fire, in order to keep Blackthorne safe from his Portuguese enemies who feared his actions with the ship (since Blackthorne still has much to teach Toranaga); and, if need be, the warlord will destroy the ship Blackthorne is currently building. He also discloses Mariko's secret but vital role in the grand deception of his enemies, and, as a result, how she was destined to die, helping to assure his coming final victory. The warlord knows that Blackthorne's <a href="/wiki/Karma" title="Karma">karma</a> brought him to Japan and that the Englishman, now his trusted retainer and samurai, is destined never to leave. Toranaga also knows it is his karma to become Shōgun.
</p><p>In an <a href="/wiki/Epilogue" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a> it is revealed that Toranaga and his army are triumphant at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara" title="Battle of Sekigahara">Battle of Sekigahara</a>; he captures and then disgraces his old rival, Lord Ishido (by burying him up to his neck), and takes 40,000 enemy heads, after which he then fulfills his destiny by becoming Shōgun.  A different voice-over narrates that when the Emperor of Japan offered Toranaga the title of Shogun, he 'reluctantly agreed'.
