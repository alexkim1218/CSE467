<p>The film opens as <a href="/wiki/San_Jose_Mercury_News" class="mw-redirect" title="San Jose Mercury News">San Jose Mercury News</a> reporter <a href="/wiki/Gary_Webb" title="Gary Webb">Gary Webb</a> interviews drug dealer Ronny Quail who is outraged that the government used <a href="/wiki/Civil_asset_forfeiture" class="mw-redirect" title="Civil asset forfeiture">civil asset forfeiture</a> to keep his house even after he was acquitted. Webb's ensuing article about the abuses of forfeiture garners repeated phone calls from a woman named Coral whom he agrees to meet when she says she has documents that prove the government sponsored <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> sales in the U.S. Coral gives Webb a transcript of grand jury testimony which was accidentally released to her boyfriend, an accused drug dealer, during <a href="/wiki/Discovery_(law)" title="Discovery (law)">discovery</a>. After Webb reveals to the prosecutor in the case that he has the transcript, the government drops the charges against Coral's boyfriend in order to protect their main witness: <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Danilo_Bland%C3%B3n" title="Oscar Danilo Blandón">Oscar Danilo Blandón</a>
</p><p>Webb researches Blandón and comes across the pending case of <a href="/wiki/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross" title="&quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross">"Freeway" Rick Ross</a> who is stunned to learn that Blandón is a paid informant. Armed with this knowledge, Ross' attorney is able to elicit from Blandón under oath the outlines of the <a href="/wiki/CIA_involvement_in_Contra_cocaine_trafficking" title="CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking">conspiracy</a>: With support from the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, Blandón and his partners smuggled cocaine into the U.S. and used the profits to benefit the Nicaraguan <a href="/wiki/Contras" title="Contras">Contras</a>.
</p><p>Webb travels to a prison in <a href="/wiki/Managua" title="Managua">Managua</a> and speaks to Blandón's partner Norwin Meneses who confirms <a href="/wiki/Oliver_North" title="Oliver North">Oliver North's</a> involvement in the basic "drugs for guns" scheme to use profits from cocaine trafficking to fund the Contras. In <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, Webb tracks down Fred Weil, a <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Council" title="National Security Council">National Security Council</a> employee who was an investigator on the <a href="/wiki/Kerry_Committee_report" title="Kerry Committee report">Kerry Committee report</a> which touched on the same issues. Like many other people he has spoken to, Weil warns Webb how dangerous the subject is. For good measure, federal agents summon Webb to a meeting where they warn him against publishing what he has learned.
</p><p>When the paper publishes Webb's story with the title "<a href="/wiki/Dark_Alliance" title="Dark Alliance">Dark Alliance</a>", it is an immediate sensation. Humiliated by being scooped by a regional paper, the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" class="mw-redirect" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> all dig into Webb's reporting. Webb views their follow-up reporting as being far too deferential to the CIA. Eventually, their reporting turns to Webb himself and an affair he had while working at the <a href="/wiki/Plain_Dealer" class="mw-redirect" title="Plain Dealer">Plain Dealer</a>.
</p><p>Webb is banished to the newspaper's <a href="/wiki/Cupertino" class="mw-redirect" title="Cupertino">Cupertino</a> bureau to cover mundane local news. However, he continues to work on the story. He is awoken in his motel room one night by John Cullen who is precisely the kind of CIA source with direct knowledge of the scheme that Webb's reporting needs. Webb's exhilaration at finding Cullen is quickly dampened when the paper reveals its plans to write an open letter calling into question aspects of its "Dark Alliance" reporting. At a <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Professional_Journalists" title="Society of Professional Journalists">Society of Professional Journalists</a> dinner honoring Webb as "Journalist of the Year", he submits his resignation to his editors.
