Plot
As described in a film magazine review,&#91;2&#93; Marie Bernais, a Breton village girl, possesses a wonderful voice which her father believes is a gift from the devil. Raoul Nieppe loves her, but fears marrying below his station, and his rejection results in a suicide attempt by Marie. She is rescued by Hector Remey who was once a tenor but is now a Punch and Judy showman. Because of his assistance, she becomes a famous singer. When Raoul finds her, she is the mistress of Gaspard Prevost, a rich merchant who has a wife. Raoul persuades Marie to end the liaison, but she discovers that his anxiety was due to a desire to possess her. Distraught, she persists in singing for soldiers even though she is warned that this would damage her voice. She once again becomes a humble peasant girl. Gaspard, now free due to the death of his wife, seeks her out, and she finds happiness in an honorable marriage.
