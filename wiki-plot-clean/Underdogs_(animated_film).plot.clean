Plot
The film begins with the narrator telling his son, Matty, a story before going to sleep, one where he will have to use his imagination.
Many years ago, Jake, a timid boy and the best foosball player around, was working in a bar in a small and quiet town. He loved Laura, a girl he met in the bar, but she did not know.
While showing Laura the foosball table, a kid named Ace arrives and challenges Jake to a game in front of Laura. Although initially the kid beats him, Jake is victorious, and everyone at the bar applauds. Outside of the bar, Ace encounters a manager who offers to take him on.
Seven years later, Jake's simple routine falls apart when Ace becomes the best football player in the world, and returns to the small town to avenge the only defeat in his life.
Now that he is famous, Ace announces that he has purchased the whole village and builds a gigantic football stadium, although he is more interested in owning the foosball table where he lost to Jake and destroying the bar where he was defeated. He also wants to win the affection of Laura.
With foosball, the bar and even his soul destroyed, Jake discovers something magical: in the face of adversity, the town's foosball players talk and plan. Together they embark on a journey full of adventures to save Laura. Along the way, they become a real team.
