Plot
San experienced a grim childhood and adolescence with her emotionally, verbally and physically abusive mother. Unrelentingly critical and demanding, San's mother was particularly obsessed with preventing her teenage daughter from taking full possession of her sexuality. San's only reprieve was her piano lessons with a kindly next-door neighbor, Jeong-hee. Years later, when the adult San learns that she's pregnant, she visits her estranged, terminally ill mother at the hospital. Despite awaiting her imminent death, her mother has not changed at all, and San wonders if she will ever be free of the painful memories.
