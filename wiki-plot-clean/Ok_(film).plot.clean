Plot
A four-man US fireteam on patrol seizes a passing young Vietnamese girl and continue to torture and kill her. Only one soldier refuses to take part in it and reports this incident to his superior, who dismisses it as simple wartime incident. As a consequence for his report, the soldier has to fear for his life.
Later, the perpetrators are convicted, although subsequent appeals reduce their sentences significantly.
The plot takes place in a Bavarian forest and reenacts the 1966 Incident on Hill 192 during the Vietnam War. The soldiers wear US uniforms, have authentic names but speak with a pronounced Bavarian accentâ€”a conscious directing decision known as Brechtian distancing effect.
