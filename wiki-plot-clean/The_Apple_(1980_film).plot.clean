Plot
In an uncut two-song prologue of the film named "Paradise Day,"&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93; Mr. Topps (Joss Ackland) creates heaven and carves the first human Alphie out of a rock, sending Alphie to Earth to meet Bibi.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;
The two take part in the 1994 Worldvision Song Festival. Despite being the most talented performers, they are beaten by BIM (Boogalow International Music) and its leader, Mr. Boogalow, who use underhanded tactics to secure a victory. The duo are approached by Mr. Boogalow to sign to his music label, but they soon discover the darker side of the music industry. Bibi is caught up in the wild lifestyle BIM offers, while Alphie risks his life to free her from the company's evil clutches. He eventually convinces her to run away with him and the pair live as hippies for a year (and produce a child) before being tracked down by Mr. Boogalow who insists Bibi owes him ten million dollars. Alphie and Bibi are saved by the Rapture, and all good souls are taken away by Mr. Topps (aka God) who arrives on scene in a flying apparition of a Rolls Royce.
