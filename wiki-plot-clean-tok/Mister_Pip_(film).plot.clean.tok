He begins reading the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations , which transfixes a young girl named Matilda ( Xzannjah ) .
She finds comfort in the story of a Victorian orphan , Pip ( Eka Darville ) , when her own world is falling apart .
The " Redskins " , an army sent to destroy the local rebels , are getting closer .
Matilda writes " Pip " in the sand .
