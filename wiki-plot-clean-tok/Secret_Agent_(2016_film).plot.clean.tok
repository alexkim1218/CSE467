Plot A Korean police captain named Lee Jung - chool ( Song Kang - ho ) has been charged with rooting out members of his country ’s resistance movement by his cruel Japanese overlords .
But while Lee has a history of selling out his own people to secure a favorable position with the Japanese , he ’s been hit harder than usual by the death of Kim Jang - ok ( Park Hee - soon ) , a resistance fighter who used to be his classmate .
The leader of the resistance , Che- san ( Lee Byung - hun ) , senses that this turncoat , if approached and handled properly , might be turned once more — this time in their favor .
And so begins an incremental , ingeniously coded psychological dance between Lee and a key resistance figure named Kim Woo- jin ( Gong
Yoo ) , whose antique shop is a front for a scheme to smuggle explosives from Shanghai into Seoul .
While Lee could theoretically bring down this operation at any moment , he seems just as likely to become an ally , thanks in no small part to Kim ’s skillful application of pressure .
